The Imperial mathematics teaching seminar is a reading group for academics, teaching fellows and postgraduate students at Imperial College London who want to explore the many facets of teaching and learning in the mathematical sciences.

We gather once per month during term to: 

- discuss papers in education research;
- host internal speakers to raise awareness of teaching related projects, initiatives and best practises;
- host external speakers who are teachers or pedagogical researchers in mathematics, statistics and other closely related fields.

If you would like to give a talk or be added to the mailing list, please contact [z.varty@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:z.varty@imperial.ac.uk).
