## About this repo 

This repository contains planning material for the Imperial maths teaching seminar and the source code for its website, which is hosted at [imperialcollegelondon.github.io/maths-teaching-seminar](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/maths-teaching-seminar).

The website is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and deployed with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

If you find any mistakes, broken bits or anything that isn't working as it should then please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/maths-teaching-seminar/issues) to let us know.

## Past Talks 

- March 2024 - Rachel Hilliam, The OU. Should support for online students differ from ‘traditional’ support?

<!--
Universities use a variety of ways to support their students and enhance their student experience. During covid it was often the support outside of traditional teaching sessions which were difficult for many places to replicate. The Open University, has over 50 year experience of teaching and supporting students who learn online and at a distance. In particular the School of Mathematics and Statistics has for many years provided innovative ways of supporting students outside the ‘classroom’ environment was therefore well prepared to support students during the COVID-19 pandemic.
This talk will outline some of the forms of support which are offered to students in the School of Mathematics and Statistics  such as online forums to help students with module choice and taster resources including diagnostic quizzes for students to self-assess their readiness to study individual modules and receive targeted support. Since 2017, these resources, and more, have been incorporated into a multi-functional student-facing website. The website enables all units, both academic and non-academic, to provide consistent academic, pastoral and social support to students studying mathematics and statistics modules online.  Analysis will be presented on how both staff and students use the site. A particular focus of this talk will explain how the website mirrors the different stages of a student’s journey, providing a one-stop shop for students to self-serve and obtain appropriate support at each point in their own student lifecycle.

- January 2024 - Paul Northrop, UCL. Connecting students with statistical research 

<!--
I describe one of the research-based learning exercises initiated by the Department of Statistical Science at UCL. First-year undergraduate students are put into groups of five or six people and assigned a statistical research paper to read. Their task is to prepare, and submit for formative assessment, a short report that communicates the key themes of the paper to a non-specialist audience. To help them, they conduct a one-hour interview with an author of the paper. We reflect on the experience of running this assessment over the past 9 years. Feedback from students and staff has mostly been very positive, despite the considerable challenges that this type of assessment poses to students at such an early stage of their studies.

## Getting started with Quarto

Quarto is an open-source system for scientific and technical publishing. It's a bit like a jupyter notebook on steroids.

Quarto provides a unified approach to literate programming in a range of languages: out-of-the-box there is support for R, Python, Julia and Observable. It also covers many different output types, all from a single markdown source file. Quarto can be compiled to HTML documents, sites and slides; PDF documents and MS Word docs - all through the magic of [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

If you've not heard of Quarto before, I'd suggest having a play around with it. Some starter projects, building in difficulty.

1. :arrow_down: [Install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) - it's easy, I promise. 
2. :memo: Try making [your first Quarto document](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/text-editor.html). (Bonus points for html + pdf output)
3. :film_projector: Jazz things up and try [making some slides](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/) (Pretty from the start, gorgeous with a little extra HTML and CSS).
4. :bust_in_silhouette:Create or revamp your own [website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).
5. :writing_hand: Add a blog to that website, perhaps by [following this tutorial](https://www.zakvarty.com/blog/2022-09-26-adding-a-quarto-blog/)!
